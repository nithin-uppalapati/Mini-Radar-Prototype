# Mini-Radar-Prototype
Mini Radar using an IR sensor along with visualization.

We (a team of 3) worked on a course project under supervision of Dr. Uday Khankhoje. We demonstrated 2-D detection of objects (within the range 4.0cms-30.0cms) in Plan Position Indicator Display (PPI Display). We built a working model of a RADAR (in 2D) by programming Arduino UNO, and by using a Sharp IR Sensor.
